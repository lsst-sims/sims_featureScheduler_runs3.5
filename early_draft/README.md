Updates:

* updating u to 38s and a few more visits (in response to throughput changes)
* adding in the early uniform rolling
* making long gap blobs respect pre-scheduled observations.
* minor shifts to DDF central positions

adding:
* taking LMC/SMC out of rolling
* updated LMC/SMC filter balance. Trying to turn down u and g a little so dark time not oversubscribed

XXX--may need to turn template requirement in the SCP to drop below 3 a year.
XXX--may want to add some of the early science things
